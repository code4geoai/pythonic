# Instructor

## Hayat Khan  

*Technology Consultant | Python Educator | Director of IT*  

### Background  
I hold an **MS in IT** and a **Master‚Äôs in Public Administration** (specializing in *E-Policy & E-Governance*) from *Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, South Korea*. With  *20 years* of experience in tech, I‚Äôve served as a:  
- **Lecturer**  
- **Computer Programmer**  
- **System Analyst**  
- **Software Engineer**  
- **Director of IT** at the *Board of Revenue, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa*  

### My Python Journey  
I began using Python in **2018** for *data analysis, visualization, and scientific computing*, later reaffirming my commitment in **2023** by completing *Google‚Äôs Python Crash Course (Coursera)*. Recently, I was inspired by **Dr. Qiusheng Wu** ([GISHub.org](https://gishub.org)), a pioneer in *geospatial open-source tools*, to consolidate my knowledge into structured tutorials.  

### Learning in the Age of AI  
While **LLMs like ChatGPT accelerate knowledge discovery**, I firmly believe in **"learning by doing"**. Python‚Äôs versatility shines when you:  
- **Write code daily** (even 10 lines!).  
- **Tinker with real datasets** (e.g., geospatial/remote sensing data).  
- **Build small projects** that solve tangible problems.  

### Why Python?  
From automating governance workflows to training AI models, Python powers:  
1. **Geospatial Analysis** (QGIS, GDAL)  
2. **Data Science & AI/ML** (PyTorch, Scikit-learn)  
3. **E-Governance** (Django, Flask)  
4. **Remote Sensing** (Rasterio, Earth Engine)  

### About This Tutorial  
This guide focuses on:  
- **Core Python** (no fluff!)  
- **Geospatial Applications & Geo AI** (my passion area)  
- **Bite-sized projects** to reinforce concepts  

*"The best way to learn is to teach."* ‚Äî If this resource helps even one beginner, I‚Äôll consider it a win.
